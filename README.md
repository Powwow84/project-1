# Maize Runner
------------------------------------------------------------------------
## WHERE AM I??? 

It was a crazy night. You had way too much to drink. You wake not knowing where you are. All you know is that this place is dark and all you have is a note. You read the note and it says. 

"Welcome to my game. Its a game of life or death. If you win, you live.  If you lose, you die. All you have to do to win is find the exit. Be careful... I left you some surprises. Hurry now, the clock is ticking."

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Synopsis

Maize Runner is a thrilling game where your mission is to locate the exit before time runs out. Just beat the clock and find your way to freedom. But watch outâ€”there are traps scattered throughout. Accidentally triggering a trap will cost you precious time, and if the clock hits zero, it's game over. So, stay sharp and make every second count!

## Tech Requirments

* JS Canvas
* DOM Manipulation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
## MVP

* Create a start screen with content text and instructions on how to play
* Add a start button to the start screen that loads the map
* Use a 2d array to create a maze in canvas
* Create a player block that can move freely within the maze
* Add a winning tile where the user wins when they reach the tile
* Add a timer with functionality to end the game
* Add a screen for game over with play again button
* Add a screen for completing the challeng with a play again button

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Stretch Goals

* Make it so the user can only see the tiles surrounding the user (darkness)
* Add traps to deduct time
* Add imagages so the player and map are not boxes 

## Super Stretch Goals

* Make traps into monsters and add a rock paper scissors game
* Add health to player and monsters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Potential roadblocks

* Learning how to make a maze with a 2D array
* learning how to load the map when the player presses start

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Approach

The approach taken was to use a combination of HTML DOM manipulation and Canvas. 

- Map rendering was done with a nested for loop using a 2D array
- An Object prototype used to create crawler objects was created
- Movement was done with event listeners that listened for key presses
- And minigame was done with simple HTML z-indexs which sent screens infront of or behind the canvas
- Most of the logic centered around Keypress's instead of an ingame loop. This is because instead of checking for states every loop, the nessesary checks were done according to keypresses

## Post Project Thoughts

* Some things I thought would be hard were actuiallt pretty simple. While others were very hard because there were no examples that were easily found on the web
* Once the major pieces and functions were done the rest of the bells and whistles were quick and easy.
* Next time its probably best to start in this order bones > creation hard functions that are nessesary components > bells and whistles.
* One thing i'll have to really look at next time is the issue with objects psawning on top of each other. But its not a issue for now.
