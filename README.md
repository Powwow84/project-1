# Maize Runner
------------------------------------------------------------------------
## WHERE AM I??? 

It was a crazy night. You had way too much to drink. You wake not knowing where you are. All you know is that this place is dark and all you have is a note. You read the note and it says. 

"Welcome to my game. Its a game of life and death. If you win you live.  If you lose, you die. All you have to do to win is find the exit. Be careful... I left you some surprises. Hurry now, the clock is ticking."

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Synopsis

Maize Runner is a thrilling game where your mission is to locate the exit before time runs out. Just beat the clock and find your way to freedom. But watch outâ€”there are traps scattered throughout. Accidentally triggering a trap will cost you precious time, and if the clock hits zero, it's game over. So, stay sharp and make every second count!
